- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @crypticcalypte, known by many names on these here interwebs.
- Iâ€™m interested in coding, Minecraft mods, and making games.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Unity coding, while considering learning how to code in Java as well beyond datapacks.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing! I'm mostly solo, as far as outside-of-school projects go, but I'm totally willing to be a soundboard if you need one :].
- How to reach me: Discord is a surefire way to get me, as I'm not much active on anything else. I'll put it here later.
